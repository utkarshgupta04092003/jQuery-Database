# jQuery-Database
In this project student details provided in the form, will display on right side Database.

A very large institution has hired you to build an application for them. They have a very large database of students and now want to move it online.
You have to build them a web page that takes student data and then enter a new record into a list on that same page.
All the fields are necessary to be filled and the addition of a new record is directly visible on the screen. They also want the page to look simple yet attractive.
